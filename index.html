      <p>Learning to code and starting from scratch is not very fun. Going to sporting events is fun. I like to support all the local Charlotte teams. I also support my alma matter NC State and all their sports teams but usually only football and basketball games are televised.</p>
      <p>Writing code right now feels a lot like getting lost in the woods. Which usually does not happen to me because I go walking with my dog, Cooper, all the time. We know many good spots to go hiking and know all the trails at our favorite spots.</p>
